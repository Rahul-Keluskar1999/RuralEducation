 Rural Education is one of the most integral part of our developing society. No society can claim to be fully developed without educating the children living in the rural regions. It is a task of great challenges such as absenteeism of teachers , inefficient teaching methods and unavailability of study material, to name a few. To better this aspect of the society, we aim to provide the basic study materials by reusing the books that people would otherwise throw away. 

 Abstract
The main problem India now faces is that all the pedagogical innovations are fit to improve the quality of urban education while the rural learners and their education remain largely neglected. With 65 percent of the population residing in rural India, education there truly deserves much more attention, especially when it is plagued with one of the major issues - unavailabilty of  educational material in rural schools due to monetary reasons. Our software aims at providing a solution for the same by creating an online portal for people to register and doname books.

Problem Statement
Inefficient and insufficient study materials.
Lack of resources 
Lack of infrastructure to simulate effective learning
Solution Proposed
To donate the study materials that are required by the educational institutes 
NGOs can distribute this material wherever required by collection them from the donators 
The NGO will pay the donators a small sum of money for their contribution
This mode of procurement of study materials is more feasible to the educational institutes as they have to pay very little in exchange for adequate study materials
The donors can make a small sum of money by making their donation
